# CNN-Networks

Project Phases
It will be mandatory to perform each of the exercises that are defined. In each exercise is defined the network that has to be created and the configuration with which it has to be trained, so you will only have to pass this definition to code with TensorFlow.

In order to have a good practice in the realization of this project we offer these recommendations:

Use the jupyter cell system correctly. The notebook is made in such a way that you will only have to fill in the cells indicated, either with code or with text in markdown. It is recommended to fill only the indicated cells in order to get a clean and easy to follow report. If it is necessary to include more cells for any reason, you can do so, but be careful not to make the notebook too dirty.
The networks that you will have to create in each experiment are the ones seen in class, so you can be inspired by the examples seen in the tutorials. I recommend that you do not copy and paste code as is, but write it on your own and understand what you are doing at each moment. Take as much time as you need to understand each step.
Check that everything runs correctly before submitting your work. The best way to send it is to export the notebook to pdf or html to send it in a more professional format.
The phases you should perform are as follows:

Phase 1: Familiarize yourself with the entire work environment.
Phase 2: Load the data and familiarize yourself with them.
Phase 3: Perform each of the indicated experiments.
